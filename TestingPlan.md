Since our project is focused around API endpoints, we created a specific testing plan to verify the struture and correctness of our code.

## Testing Plan

1. Verify that each endpoint is written correct and doesn't have any syntax errors
  - Check to make sure for correct paraters being passed into the function and returned afterward
2. Test the SQL code inside a query tool with the Augur Database for a correct response
3. Locally test the endpoint by searching up its URL and checking to see if the JSON file displays the correct values
4. Finally check to make sure endpoints are displaying the correct data instead of possibly correct data
5. If any step fails, retreat to the first step after making edits to the code
